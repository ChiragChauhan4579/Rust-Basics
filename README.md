# Rust ðŸ¦€

According to WikiPedia: Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language that emphasizes performance, type safety, and concurrency. It enforces memory safetyâ€”meaning that all references point to valid memoryâ€”without a garbage collector. To simultaneously enforce memory safety and prevent data races, its "borrow checker" tracks the object lifetime of all references in a program during compilation.

Rust was influenced by ideas from functional programming, including immutability, higher-order functions, and algebraic data types. It is popular for systems programming.

This repository is created as a learning tutorials by following various youtube videos and rust docs.

# basics_and_variables folder

## Starting a rust project

It is necessary to run `cargo init` so that all the necessary cargo files and one main.rs inside src folder will be created in the directory.

```
mkdir rust-project
cd rust-project
cargo init
```

## Variables 

You can define variables using the let keyword similar to JS. You can assign the type of the variable, or it can be inferred as well.

Also we can use variables directly while printing by usin them inside {}. Similar to f-string in python just that it does not require f.

## Data types

The data types in rust are similar to every other language. Most common integer, float, boolean.

There are char and string types in rust. Char holds a single character or part of a character while String holds a sequence of characters. To define charater we use '' and for string we use "".

Like python we have tuple and array (list). tuple elements can be accessed by using . and array elements can be accessed by using [].

To print all values of tuple and array one must use :? to print. Example: println!("{arr:?}") or println!("{:?}",arr)

## Variable mutability
Variables are immutable by default. Prefix the variable name with mut keyword to make it mutable.

## Notes
- Variable declared without keyword mut will raise error if its value is tried to change
- Variable if not used anywhere will raise compilation warnings. The code will still work.

## Unused variables

When there are are unused variables, warnings are shown. In case we have two solutions.
1. add _ before the variable
2. add #[allow(unused_variables)] at the top of code

## Shadowing and Rebinding

You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable, here we can say the first one is shadowed by the second one.

When we shadow a variable it is necessary to add mut keyword again so that it is still mutable.

## Checking variable type

To check variable type we use std::any::type_name crate and write a function for it.

## Check memory size 

TO check size use size_of_val from std::mem crate.

# functions folder

One must have understood the use of fn keyword and main function which is the entry point of any rust program. Now we will look at how to call another function from our main function.

In rust when we pass argument value we can define its specific type as well as the returning type to avoid any errors in the system.

## Statement and expression

Statement and expression are two important things in function. Statement are used when you do not have produce a value and only run a piece of code. They end with ;. All the code lines are statements. Expression is used to produce a resultant value. Can be used to return value from one function to another. Does not end with ; or anything.

So when you want to print something out of a statement you can give return type as () by using `fn func() -> ()` and also put a semicolon after the print statement.

But if you want to return a value don't put semicolon after that particular value.

In the code I have shown a code with function sum. It takes x and y as i32 and returns a i32 data type. If you pass some other value there then it will throw an error.

## Note:
1. To return a specific data type from function use -> datatype.
2. Don't end the value with semicolon if it to be returned.
3. Ensure return type and returned value to be of same type. 
4. An evaluating value cannot be returned. Example if you try to write x = x + 2 as an return value it would return (). So you have to write that as an statement ending with semicolon and give x as an expression in the end.
